# Fluree Developer Community Home

This repo is used to organize community interactions with the Fluree product
team. Open issues here and they will get triaged and routed to the appropriate
project.

[Fluree](https://flur.ee/) is an open-source JSON-LD graph database with
fine-grained cryptographic security written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).
This project provides an HTTP interface for the database, letting you perform
the database's core API functions via HTTP calls. This makes the database usable
from any programming language that supports HTTP.

There are many other ways to run Fluree, including by embedding it directly in a
frontend javascript application. The HTTP API server is your best choice if
you're looking to use Fluree in a manner similar to traditional databases like
MySQL and Postgres.

See [the Fluree
tutorial](https://next.developers.flur.ee/docs/learn/tutorial/introduction/) for
instructions on storing and querying data.
